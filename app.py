# WHO Hand Washing Classification ðŸ§¼ðŸ§¼ðŸ§¼

Due to the recent COVID-19 outbreak, handwashing with soap can be one of the defenses against the virus. 
By practising hand hygiene, it can be used to protect us from these diseases, as such the practice of handwashing at
regular intervals should be encouraged and promoted. With the seven-step hand washing technique (broken down into 
12 actions) endorsed by the CDC and World Health Organization (WHO), we would like to promote this 
proper hand washing technique to ensure that the hand washing steps are followed correctly. By using machine learning 
to identify if the hand washing steps are being followed correctly, users can be notified if they have missed out on 
some actions.
